## 📝 Description  
The **Academic Program Analyzer** is a Python application 🐍 that allows users to **manage and analyze** an academic program's **courses and prerequisites** using a **graph-based approach** 🔗. The program features a **graphical user interface (GUI)** 🖥️ built with **Tkinter** and **NetworkX** to **visualize and process course dependencies** efficiently.

## ✨ Features  
✔ **Add courses and specify prerequisites** 📚  
✔ **Identify courses without prerequisites** 🚀  
✔ **Find courses with the most and least prerequisites** 📊  
✔ **Check for circular dependencies** 🔄  
✔ **User-friendly GUI for easy input and visualization** 🎨

## 🔧 How It Works  

### 🏗️ Core Components  

- **📌 Graph Representation:**  
  - The program models courses as **nodes** and prerequisites as **directed edges** using `networkx.DiGraph()`.  
- **🖥️ GUI Interface:**  
  - A `Tkinter` window allows users to **enter courses, view dependencies, and analyze course relationships**.  
- **🎯 Event-Driven Functions:**  
  - Buttons trigger **specific analyses** and **display results in real time**.

### ⚙️ Main Functions  

🔹 `add_course(course, prerequisites)`: ➕ Adds a course as a node and its prerequisites as directed edges.  
🔹 `courses_without_prerequisites()`: 🧐 Finds courses that do not have any prerequisites.  
🔹 `courses_with_most_prerequisites()`: 📈 Identifies courses that require the most prerequisite courses.  
🔹 `courses_with_least_prerequisites()`: 📉 Identifies courses that require the least prerequisite courses.  
🔹 `has_circular_dependencies()`: 🔄 Checks for **circular dependencies** in the course prerequisites.

## 🚀 How to Run the Program  

1️⃣ **Install Python** (if not already installed) 🐍  
2️⃣ **Install dependencies** using:  
   ```bash
   pip install networkx
